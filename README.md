##Diabetes Prediction Using KNN
This project demonstrates the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on a diabetes dataset to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on various health indicators.

#Project Overview
In this project, the KNN model is trained on the diabetes dataset to classify patients as either diabetic (Outcome = 1) or healthy (Outcome = 0). The model uses several features like glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, BMI, and others to make predictions.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a diabetes dataset with the following features:

-Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
-Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
-BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
-SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
-Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
-BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
-DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
-Age: Age (years)
-Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1), indicating whether the patient has diabetes

#Key Steps
1-Data Normalization: The data is normalized to bring all feature values within the range [0, 1] to ensure that the KNN algorithm treats all features equally.

2-Training and Testing: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 90% of the data used for training and 10% for testing.

3-Model Training: The KNN model is trained using the training data. The n_neighbors parameter (k) is varied to find the optimal value for best performance.

4-Model Evaluation: The model's accuracy is evaluated on the test data to determine the effectiveness of the model.

5-Prediction: The trained model is used to predict the outcome for new patient data.

#Results
The accuracy of the model was evaluated for different values of k (number of neighbors). The optimal value of k was determined to be 3, which provided an accuracy rate of 83.12% on the test data.

#Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

#How to Run
Clone the repository.
Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the model and make predictions.

#KNN Algorithm
The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a simple, yet powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the k closest data points in the training set to a given test point and assigning the most common label among those neighbors.
